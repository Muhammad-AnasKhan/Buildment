// Which moment earns which reaction. Rules are data: the engine picks the highest-priority rule
// that matches any event in a batch, then applies cooldowns. The words the mascot says live in
// mascot-messages.en.json, keyed by rule id, so wording changes never touch this logic.
// Message rules:
//   - Celebrate effort, never count failures or time away ("Yay, you're back!", not "5 days").
//   - Each rule has a few lines in the same spirit so the mascot does not repeat itself; the first
//     is the canonical one.
//   - Lines never name a course, so they fit every course and their recorded voice clips do too.
//   - Reactions the learner did not just cause are `ambient` and wait for a page where they are not
//     reading, so nothing interrupts a chapter.
//   - Help is offered, never imposed: a reaction can carry one action, and the learner may ignore it.
