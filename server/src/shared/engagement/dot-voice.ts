// Dot's recorded voice: twelve short clips (Kai on ElevenLabs), served by the web app from
// /brand/dot/voice/<key>.mp3 and listed with their wording in frontend/public/brand/dot/manifest.json.
// A rule names its clip (EngagementRule.clip) and then says exactly the clip's words, so what the
// learner reads and hears always match. Rules without a clip show their line silently.
// Sound rules: off until the learner turns it on, never during a quiz, once per moment.
